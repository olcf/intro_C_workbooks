Below is a code written in C that draws a heart on the screen in ASCII charaters. 
The user is able to control the size of the heart by entering the nubmer of rows tall for the main body of the heart.
We are going to use this code to introduce you to C. 

Goals
* Learn to compile and run a C-code.
* Learn aboout a few of the basic coding structures in C.
* Play with the code to see what it does.

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i,j, rows;

    printf("Enter the number of rows\n");
    scanf("%d", &rows);
    /* printing top semi circular shapes of heart */
    for(i = rows/2; i <= rows; i+=2){
     /* Printing Spaces */
        for(j = 1; j < rows-i; j+=2) {
            printf(" ");
        }
        /* printing stars for left semi circle */
        for(j = 1; j <= i; j++){
            printf("S");
        }
        /* Printing Spaces */
        for(j = 1; j <= rows-i; j++){
            printf(" ");
        }
        /* printing stars for right semi circle */
        for(j = 1; j <= i; j++){
            printf("S");
        }
        /* move to next row */
        printf("\n");
    }

    /* printing inverted start pyramid */
    for(i = rows; i >= 1; i--){
        for(j = i; j < rows; j++){
            printf(" ");
        }
        for(j = 1; j <= (i*2)-1; j++){
            printf("S");
        }
        /* move to next row */
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```


**Compile and Run the Code** 

Login to the open DTN and clone this repositry in your home area if you have not already done so. 

Login help: See slide 10 : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xUCsLPY6ehkugdraxgoWCLAmrkWOod6IT0S07BYeDIg/edit?usp=sharing

To clone: 

```
git clone 

```

We will use some Unix commands to change to the directory where the code is. 

We will now use the GNU compiler to compile this code. The compiler translates the code into machine language that the computer can understand and writes an executable file for you to run. 

This initial translation of all the code is what gives compiled languages their speed for HPC because no time is need for the computer to interpret the code as it runs. 

The compile command for the GNU compiler is `gcc`, Compile the code with:

```
gcc heart.c 

```
This generates a file that you can run (an executable) called `a.out’. This is the default name for an executable generated by most compilers. There are commands to give executables specific names, but we don’t need to do that yet. 

To run the program: 

```
./a.out
```

You should see a heart of the size you specified by giving the program the number of rows. 
Play with this code by running it with different numbers of row. 
•	What part of the heart has the number of rows you chose? 
•	What character is the heart made of? 

**Put your Initals in the Heart** 

Now let’s modify the code by changing the printed character to be your first or last initial. 

First copy the original code to a new file called heary_mod.c

```
cp heart.c heart_mod.c

```
Then look at the file with vi. 

```
vi heart_mod.c 

```
To put vi in Insert mode type ‘i’. You terminal screen should say -- INSERT --  in the bottom left corner. Vi behaves a lot like any word processor when it is in Insert mode. You can move the cursor with the arrows and delete and add charters just like you would in MSWord. 

Look for all the place in the code that have  ` printf("S");’.

Replace the “S” with your First or Last initials. If you like, replace different S’s with different initials from your name. 

To save your changes. Type “:wq”.  This will close vi and save your changes. 

Recompile and run the code. 

**Change The Shape of the Heart**


Now let’s try changing the shape of the heart. We’ll do this as an experiment. 

But here are some expiations to help. 

The heart is generated in a code structure called a `for loop`. It’s actually a set of nested for loops. These loops change the integer variables i and j though a sequence that uses them to count how many spaces and characters to print to the screen. j oversees calculating how many spaces and charters to print and i limits how big or small the value of j needs to be based on the number of rows you entered. You don’t have to fully understand this, to do some experiments that change the heart’s shape. 

Let’s play with one of these loops to see what happens when we change how large the step that i or j will make with each iteration of their for loops. 

Here is the start i-based loop for the top of the heart, 
```
for(i = rows/2; i <= rows; i+=2){

```
In English this says 
For
i-rows/2;  ( i equal to the number of rows divided by 2)
i <= rows; ( as long as i is less than or equal to the number of rows
; i+=2, increment i in steps of 2.  

So, if you have entered 6 for the number of rows 
This loop will start at 3 (6/2) and then move to 5 (3+2) and then to 7(5+2), but 7 is greater than the number of rows (6) so the loop will stop running. 

What happens to the shape of the heart if we change `; i+=2’ on the end of the loop to `; i+=3’?
Make this change and recompile and run the code. 
 
What happens to the shape of the heart if we change `; i+=2’ on the end of the loop to `; i+=1’?
Make this change and recompile and run the code. 


If there is time left, play with all the for loop limits to change the shape of the heart.
