## The C Programming Language 

C is a general programming language initally deveopled by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories. 
It is a compiled language, which means that a program called a compiler is used to translate the code that you write in C into 
machine langauge that your computer can use. 

Many operating systems and scripting programming language are written with C. Examples include Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. 

C is one of the most common prgramming languages used for High Performace Computing. 

Here is a simple example to show the very basics of C. 

```
/*------------------------------------------------------------
Program that prints that value of an integer to the screen.
------------------------------------------------------------*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

    int a = 3;
    printf("The value of this integer is %d\n", a);
